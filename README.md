Coypu
=====

### Coypu is
* A robust wrapper for browser automation tools (e.g. Selenium WebDriver) to ease automating js/ajax-heavy websites from .Net and SpecFlow/Cuke4Nuke
* A more intuitive API for interacting with the browser, inspired by the ruby framework Capybara - http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
