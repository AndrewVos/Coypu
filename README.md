Coypu
=====

### What?
Coypu is designed for those special cases when you're forced to use .NET and can't make us of Cucumber/Capybara. Basically, it's like Capybara for .NET.

### Coypu is
* A robust wrapper for browser automation tools (e.g. Selenium WebDriver) to ease automating js/ajax-heavy websites from .Net and SpecFlow/Cuke4Nuke
* A more intuitive API for interacting with the browser, inspired by the ruby framework Capybara - http://github.com/jnicklas/capybara
